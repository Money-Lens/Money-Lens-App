# Retrospective of Sprint 2

## What went well

- Got everything we planned to do done for the most part 
- Features worked well 
- Set early deadlines helped prevent last minute rush and kept the group accountable and deliver on issues on time
- Each member was accountable in their assigned tasks
- Communication on discord works well for the team

## Areas of Improvement

- There were some errors in the authenication system
- Some paired programmers need extra help outside their team 
- The deliverables not added as an issue like the sequence diagrams were not assigned and left to the last day

Testing: 

  - tests weren't really assigned until the last couple days
  - couldn't get code coverage for tests. We think it might be related to useing the built in mocks with Jest
  - testing was left to the implement in the last couple days before deadline

Meetings: 

- Having everyone remember meeting times. Not all members could make scheuduled meeting due to forgetting. 

## Solutions

Authentication System: 

  - Add edge case solutions for authentication 
  - Resetting password bugs
  - Remember me UI

Testing: 

- Add more test cases and edge cases for each feature as we are implementing them rather than afterward. 
- Try implementing a mock database for testing 
- Make sure the libraries used are consistent between users

Meetings: 

- Create a weekly meeting reminder 
- Create an event in discord for the weekly meeting 

Timeline: 

- Continue to set deadlines for issues and hold others accountable

Include all deliverables in the repository issues so they are not missed.
