# Assigning Sprint 2 Tasks

We decided to work on features in groups of 2 for this sprint. One person focusing on backend and another on frontend. In the following sprints we will alternate roles to gain full stack experience. 

## Features 

- Authentication System
    - Filip
    - Aakash
- Dashboard
    - Ginelle 
    - Una
- Import transaction information via API
    - Gill
    - Sahil
- Import transaction information vs CSV
    - Alternative to import via API if it's not possible
    - Gill
    - Sahil

Feature groups will decide and assign tasks amongst themselves.

## UI Layout 

We'll aim for an aesthetic blue and white design with a side menu and top nav bar. The Dashboard will have Account balance, a chart of monthly cash flow and a list of recent transactions. 

The login page with have a clean, simple look.

## Database

We are unsure if it is necessary to use a docker container for the database and think it would be easier to just use the mongodb cloud. We will consult Mr. Wang what is recommended and required for the project. 

## Code Review 

We will revisit how we want to conduct code reviews. Our initial plan will be to have the other feature group member and one other person in the team to review code before merging.
