# Money Lens

Money Lens is a personal finance web application that seeks to make money management intuitive and user friendly. It allows users to securely import financial data through multiple methods, including direct bank account connections and CSV uploads. Once imported, users can search, filter, categorize, or edit their transaction history, and explore it through graphs and statistics. Users can also create and track custom spending and savings goals.

For more information about our project, plans, and instructions on how to run the app, see our [Wiki page](https://github.com/Money-Lens/Money-Lens-App/wiki).
